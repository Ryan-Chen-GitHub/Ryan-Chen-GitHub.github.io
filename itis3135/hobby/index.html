      <h2>Who</h2>
      <figure>
        <img style="width: 55%" src="/itis3135/hobby/images/Botc.png">
        <figcaption>The townsfolk in the town, with the evil members hidden among them</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p><i>The prompt used for this image was: "A demon hiding among town members, make it slightly ominous"</i></p>
      <p>This game was created by a group called "The Pandemonium Institute, who frequently update the game with new content every month.</p>
      <p>They are known for hosting weekly matches of Blood on the Clocktower on their Twitch and also post videos on Youtube</p>

      <h2>What</h2>
      <figure>
        <img style="width: 55%" src="/itis3135/hobby/images/bloody_clocktower_resized.png">
        <figcaption>A "Bloody" Clocktower, where the game takes place</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p><i>The prompt used for the image was: "Bloody clocktower that has similar architecture as a london tower but not too bloody"</i></p>
      <p>Welcome to Blood on the Clocktower! Also referred to as BOTC, Blood on the Clocktower is a Social deduction based game (Similar to the Party game "Mafia") where a Good team tries to identify who the Evil members among them are before the Evil Team kills off the Town one by one. </p>
      <p>This game is usually played in person, although it can be played online with some adjustments, it is a game where everyone has fun, good or bad, dead or alive!</p>
    </section>
    <section id="when" style="display: none;">
      <h2>When</h2>
      <figure>
        <img style="width: 55%" src="/itis3135/hobby/images/Salem_noose.png">
        <figcaption>Players who are executed during the day die to a noose</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p><i>The prompt used for the image was: "A person standing in front of a noose during the salem witch trials, make it slightly ominous"</i></p>
      <p>This game takes place during the Salem period, where people were executed over the smallest suspicion. During the day, the Town can execute players that they think are suspicious, if they are the Demon, then the town wins instantly, although it isn't as easy as it sounds</p>
      <p>Not only is it difficult to identify the Demon, but even if the Demon is identified, the Minions that support the demon have ways of interfering with the execution, or can even replace the Demon</p>
    </section>
    <section id="where" style="display: none;">
      <h2>Where</h2>
      <figure>
        <img style="width: 55%" src="/itis3135/hobby/images/playing_botc.png">
        <figcaption>Players sitting in a circle when playing Blood on the Clocktower</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p><i>The prompt used for the image was: "Playing a party game with friends during a party, with everyone sitting in a circle, make it slightly ominous"</i></p>
      <p>This game can either be played in person with friends and family, with everyone sitting in a circle, or it can be played online, where an online system is used to have everyone "sit" in a circle.</p>
      <p>When playing, players may step to the side with another player to talk in private, but may not change where they sit in the circle.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="how" style="display: none;">
      <h2>How</h2>
      <figure>
        <img style="width: 55%" src="/itis3135/hobby/images/seven_member_town_resized.png">
        <figcaption>The townsfolk in the town, with the evil members hidden among them</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p><i>The prompt used for this image was: "A town with 7 members, make it slightly ominous"</i></p>
      <p>How do you play? If you are playing in person you can use a physical Grimoire (which keeps track of how the game is going), or you can use an online version if playing online. The game contains 4 types of roles that players fall into, with how they work and how they win listed below.</p>
      <figure>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Role</th>

                <th>How to Win</th>

            <tr>
                <th>Townsfolk (Good)</th>
                <th>You are a standard Good player, and have an ability that will help Good win</th>

            <tr>
                <th>Outsider (Good)</th>
                <th>You are a Good player that has an ability which hinders the Good Team's ability to win</th>
                <th>Find and Execute the Demon hiding in the town</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th>Minion (Evil)</th>
                <th>You are Minion working for the Demon, who wants to take over the town</th>
                <th>Help the Demon make it to the end of the game</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th>Demon</th>
                <th>You are the Demon, your goal is to take over the town and survive</th>
                <th>Survive until the end of the game</th>
            </tr>
        </table>

    </section>
    <section id="why" style="display: none;">
      <h2>Why</h2>
      <figure>
        <img style="width: 55%" src="/itis3135/hobby/images/botc_skeleton.png">
        <figcaption>Both dead and living players in the game playing at the same time</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p><i>The prompt used for the image was: "People sitting in a circle playing a game with a living skeleton, make it slightly ominous"</i></p>
      <p>Why play this game? During this game, players may end up dying (fictionally) during the process of trying to find the Demon, however, dying is not the end in this game.</p>
      <p>Dead players can play the game just as much as living players can, with some restrictions. This allows both Good and Evil to keep tricking each other until the very end.</p>
