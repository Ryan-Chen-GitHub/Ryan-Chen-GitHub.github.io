        <p>Madewell is an Online Website that sells a variety of clothing like Jackets, Dresses, and Jeans. On the surface it may look like a well designed website, however there are some glaring issues that do not follow CRAP principles.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Contrast:</b> There are instances where white text is layed over a light background or black text on a dark background</li>
            <li><b>Repetition:</b> The repetition on this website is the only part that's good, there is a straight line that goes down the center for many of the different products they have on sale, and it doesn't fail to keep that pattern.</li>
            <li><b>Alignment:</b> The alignment seems very off at the bottom of the main page, where the margins don't seem to match on both the left and right sides.</li>
            <li><b>Proximity:</b> The proximity seems like it was not taken into account, there are two completely different ways of accessing the men's clothing section and Madewell insider</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 style="text-align:center">Good Website Design: <a href="https://spotify.design/">Spotify Design</a></h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Contrast:</b> The color choices are well picked, with black text on light background and white text on dark backgrounds</li>
            <li><b>Repetition:</b> This website is very consistent in jumping between banners and tiles to show information toward the user.</li>
            <li><b>Alignment:</b> The alignment is perfect in this website, margins are amazing and the alignment is intentionally messed with to add flare in the tile sections</li>
            <li><b>Proximity:</b> Each category get their own clear dedicated space on the website, with the most important informatiom closer to the top</li>
